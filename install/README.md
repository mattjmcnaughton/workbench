# Package Management System

A lightweight, bash-based package management system for development tools and dependencies.

## Overview

This system provides a simple, script-based approach to managing development tools and dependencies. It's designed to be:
- Lightweight (bash-based, no external dependencies)
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Configurable (via environment variables)
- Cross-platform (currently Ubuntu 24.04, with plans to support other platforms)
