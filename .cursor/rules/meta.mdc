# Toolbox Project Cursor Rules
# Priority: Security, Simplicity, Clear Documentation

This is a developer toolbox project containing development environment setup
scripts, configuration files (dotfiles), and bootstrap utilities for new
systems.

## Core Principles

1. **Security First**: Never store secrets or credentials. Always validate
inputs. Use secure defaults.
2. **Simplicity**: Write clear, readable code. Each component does one thing
well.
3. **Clear Documentation**: Every component is documented with examples and
usage instructions.

## Working Guidelines

1. Understand existing patterns before making changes
2. Prioritize security in all decisions
3. Keep changes focused and minimal
4. Update documentation alongside code
5. Test changes on clean systems
6. Consider backward compatibility
